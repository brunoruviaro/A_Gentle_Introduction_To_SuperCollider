\section{Extra Resources}

This is the end of this introduction to SuperCollider. A few extra learning resources are listed below. Enjoy!

\begin{itemize}
\item An excellent series of YouTube tutorials by Eli Fieldsteel: \url{http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPYzvS8A_rTaNDweXe6PX4CXSGq4iEWYC}. 

\item The standard SC get-started tutorial by Scott Wilson and James Harkins, available online and in the built-in Help files: \url{http://doc.sccode.org/Tutorials/Getting-Started/00-Getting-Started-With-SC.html}

\item The official SuperCollider mailing list is the best way to get friendly help from a large pool of users. Beginners are very welcome to ask questions in this list. You can sign up here: \url{http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/facilities/BEAST/research/supercollider/mailinglist.aspx}

\item Find a SuperCollider meet-up group in your city. The official sc-users mailing list is the best way to find out if there is one where you live. If there is no meet-up group in your area, start one!

\item Lots of interesting snippets of code can be found here: \url{http://sccode.org/}. Sign up for an account and share your code too.
