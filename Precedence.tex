\section{Precedence}

SuperCollider follows a left to right order of precedence, regardless of operation. This means, for example, that multiplication does \emph{not} happen first:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=SuperCollider-IDE, basicstyle=\scttfamily\footnotesize]
// In high school, the result was 9; in SC, it is 14:
5 + 2 * 2; 
// Use parentheses to force a specific order of operations:
5 + (2 * 2); // equals 9.
\end{lstlisting}

When combining messages and binary operations, messages take precedence. For example, in \texttt{5 + 2.squared}, the squaring happens first.
