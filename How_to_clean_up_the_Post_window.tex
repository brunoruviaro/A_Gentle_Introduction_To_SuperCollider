\section{How to clean up the Post window}

This is such a useful command for cleaning freaks that it deserves a section of its own: [ctrl+shift+P]. Evaluate this line and enjoy cleaning the Post window afterwards:

 
\begin{lstlisting}[style=SuperCollider-IDE, basicstyle=\scttfamily\footnotesize]
100.do({"Print this line over and over...".scramble.postln});
\end{lstlisting}
 
You're welcome.
