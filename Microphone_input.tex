\section{Microphone Input}

The example below shows how you can easily access sound input from your sound card with the \texttt{SoundIn} UGen.\footnote{Since \texttt{In.ar} will read from any bus, and you know that your soundcard inputs are by default assigned to buses 8-15, you could write \texttt{In.ar(8)} to get sound from your microphone. That works just fine, but \texttt{SoundIn.ar} is a more convenient option.}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=SuperCollider-IDE, basicstyle=\scttfamily\footnotesize]
// Warning: use headphones to avoid feedback
{SoundIn.ar(0)}.play; // same as In.ar(8): takes sound from the first input bus

// Stereo version
{SoundIn.ar([0, 1])}.play; // first and second inputs

// Some reverb just for fun?
{FreeVerb.ar(SoundIn.ar([0, 1]), mix: 0.5, room: 0.9)}.play;
\end{lstlisting}
