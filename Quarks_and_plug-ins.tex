\section{Quarks and plug-ins}

You can extended the functionality of SuperCollider by adding classes and UGens created by other users. \emph{Quarks} are packages of SuperCollider classes, extending what you can do in the SuperCollider language. \emph{UGen plugins} are extensions for the SuperCollider audio synthesis server.

Please visit \url{http://supercollider.github.io/} to get up-to-date information on how to add plug-ins and quarks to your SuperCollider installation. The ``Using Quarks'' Help file is also a good starting point: \url{http://doc.sccode.org/Guides/UsingQuarks.html}. From any SuperCollider document, you can evaluate \texttt{Quarks.gui} to see a list of all available quarks (it opens in a new window).
